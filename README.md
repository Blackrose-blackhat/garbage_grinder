# Garbage Grinder

Frontend for a garbage regulation service, written using Flutter.
Made a app named "Garbage Grinder" in which we take the record of the house from those we have collected garbage to get it recycled and give them rewards in coins in the basis of what amount of carbon footprint they given and so they can redeem too.

To use the app, download one of our releases for Android platform or build it yourself by downloading the `master` branch.
